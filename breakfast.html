                The viral trend of frying an egg in feta was already genius and I think this sheet pan version does it one better: You cook eight eggs at a time right in the oven, where the cheese gets all melty and mingles with the smoky roasted tomatoes. — Recipe Editor Susan Choung

            If you didn’t see the recipe for yourself you wouldn’t know these whole wheat pancakes are made without eggs.

            They are so wonderfully soft and fluffy, tasty, and surprisingly healthy. Perfect for breakfast or brunch!
            
            This Eggless Pancake recipe is also quick and easy to make in only 15 minutes with basic pantry staples. Simply combine dry ingredients with a mixture of milk and butter, then whisk to create an airy batter.
