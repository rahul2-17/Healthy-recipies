            1. Rinse 1½ cups (200 grams) basmati rice very well in water. Soak the rice in enough water for 30 minutes. When the rice is soaking, chop all the vegetables and keep aside
            <br>
            <br>

            2. Prepare the biryani masala. For it, the spices that we use are – 1 inch cinnamon stick, 4 cloves, 4 green cardamoms and a single strand of mace (not the whole mace as it is a strong spice).
            <br>
            <br>

            3. Add these in a small grinder or spice grinder and grind to a powder. Keep aside.
