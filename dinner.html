            <center>Pasta with Garlicky Tomato Sauce & Bay Scallops Is Easy but Elegant</center>

            <ul>
                <li>Bring a medium pot of water to a boil over high heat. Add 8 ounces spaghetti; cook according to package directions for al dente. Drain the pasta, reserving 1½ cups cooking water; return the pasta to the pot</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, cook the scallops. Working in 2 batches, heat 1½ teaspoons oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add half of the scallops; cook, undisturbed, until lightly browned on the bottoms, about 4 minutes. Flip and continue to cook, stirring often, until just cooked through, about 1 minute; transfer to a large plate. Repeat the process with 1½ teaspoons oil and the remaining scallops. Do not wipe the skillet clean.</li>
                <li>Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet; heat over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon garlic; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add 3 cups tomatoes and 1 teaspoon salt; cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes are softened and begin to burst, about 6 minutes. Add ¼ cup pasta cooking water and ¼ cup wine. Lightly crush some of the tomatoes with the back of a spoon. Add the chopped  zucchini; bring to a simmer. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce slightly thickens, about 3 minutes. Stir in the pasta and ¼ cup basil; cook, stirring and tossing constantly and adding more pasta water as needed, ¼ cup at a time, until the sauce thickens and coats the pasta, about 3 minutes. Stir in the scallops. Garnish with additional basil, if desired.</li>
